# Project Light
Hi! I am Roque, a young Game Designer passionated about Combat Design.

In this repository you can find the prototype of combat mechanics I developed as a part of my Bachelor thesis. 
This prototype has been programmed with UE4 Blueprints.
Feel free to reuse it for your projects and modify in the way you want!
