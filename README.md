# Project Light
Hi! I am Roque, a young Game Designer passionated about Combat Design.

In this repository you can find the prototype of combat mechanics I developed as a part of my Bachelor thesis. 
This prototype has been programmed using UE4 Blueprints.
Feel free to reuse it in your projects and modify it in the way you want!
